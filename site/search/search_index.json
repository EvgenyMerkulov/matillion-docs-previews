Prerequisites You need to know how to authenticate with your third-party service. It's recommended to have your third-party's API documentation to hand, as well as their API's main URL. Add connector If you don't have any connectors yet, click Add connector in the middle of the pane. Your new connector will begin with a placeholder name such as Untitled Connector X . Click the edit button and rename your connector to something unique and descriptive. Request Set the request to either GET or POST . If you're not sure which request method to use, it's probably a GET , but please consult your third-party's API documentation. Paste or add your endpoint URL. Authentication :::info The specific authentication details you enter here are only used for making test requests, and aren't saved as part of the connector - Matillion Platform only saves the authentication type. You'll be asked to enter authentication details when you set up a pipeline with this connector. ::: Set the authentication type by clicking the dropdown. Basic Auth requires the username and password used to access the third-party service. Bearer Token requires a single bearer token from your third-party service. API Key requires a key name and the value of the key. Additionally, you can set the API key as a header or query parameter. OAuth requires an OAuth entry. Select one from the dropdown, or click Add new OAuth .

Choose either Authorization Code or Client Credentials. Which should I use? Credentials Mechanism Select whether the credentials will be formatted in the request body or as request headers when initially requesting an access token. This parameter is only available when Grant Type is Authorization Code . Client ID A unique client ID string for your application. This credential will be available when you create an app for your data source service in the corresponding developer portal. Client Secret A unique client secret string for your application. This credential will be available when you create an app for your data source service in the corresponding developer portal. Typically, the client secret is located underneath or after the client ID. Please note, some services will only reveal a client secret once upon creation of an app, and therefore it's vital that you copy and save the client secret in a secure location for later access.

Client Credentials : the details you enter are all that's needed to authenticate on an ongoing basis. It is recommended that the client credentials flow where possible, because it's the most appropriate for this kind of integration and there are fewer potential issues.

The data plane and control plane split ensures data sovereignty is adhered to. What's a data plane? This is an abstract concept that ties together an execution environment, for example, AWS Fargate, that uses an ETL Agent. This ETL Agent will be provided by Matillion as a Docker image. What's the ETL Agent? The ETL Agent is the software that executes the job tasks that traditionally run within Matillion ETL. The ETL Agent communicates with the Agent Gateway by an egress-only method. This provides the job tasks, from the SaaS platform, that will be executed. The ETL Agent can scale up by having many instances running concurrently and this can be set based on requirements. There are plans to make this scalable; however, at this moment, they are sized manually or via any cloud provider\u2019s own scaling mechanism. What's the Agent Gateway? The Agent Gateway is the communication portal that agents will use to communicate with the SaaS Platform. The ETL Agents poll the Agent Gateway for work, as well as send responses for those work tasks. Considerations Matillion Unlimited Scale is presently only available for Matillion ETL for Snowflake (AWS). Matillion Unlimited Scale private preview supports a reduced list of components. However, this list will grow over time. Matillion will provide you with a specific Matillion ETL instance for Unlimited Scale. To run Matillion Unlimited Scale, you must create an ETL Agent. For this to work successfully, you will need to create a number of resources in Amazon Web Services (AWS). Matillion will supply a demo job once you are set up with Matillion Unlimited Scale. If this demo job runs successfully, then your Matillion Unlimited Scale instance is connected to your ETL Agent and working as expected. Matillion recommends that credentials are stored externally where possible\u2014for example, via AWS Secrets Manager. OAuth entries may need to be recreated\u2014such as for Salesforce Query.

Running workloads with sensitive data during the private preview period of Matillion Unlimited Scale. Help us improve Matillion Unlimited Scale Matillion Unlimited Scale is still in development.
